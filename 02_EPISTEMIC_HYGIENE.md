## The Problem

AI agents confabulate. They present speculation as fact, fill uncertainty with plausible-sounding content, and deliver confident answers when the honest response is "I don't know." This isn't malice — it's architecture. Language models are optimised for fluency, and fluency and accuracy are different things.

The result: agents that sound authoritative while being wrong. Users who trust outputs that shouldn't be trusted. Systems built on foundations that nobody checked.

The deeper version of this problem: **epistemic contamination** — the gradual drift of hypotheses into assumed facts, of design specifications into claimed physics, of tentative conclusions into foundational axioms. Each step feels reasonable. The cumulative effect is a system that claims far more than it has demonstrated.

## The Solution: Tag Everything

Every claim an agent makes or stores falls into one of three categories:

```
✅  PROVEN      — Operationally demonstrated. Independently reproducible.
                   Survives adversarial scrutiny. You can build on this.

△  CONDITIONAL  — Theoretically grounded. Reasonable. But depends on 
                   assumptions that haven't been fully validated. Proceed 
                   with awareness. Mark the assumptions explicitly.

◇  OPEN         — Genuinely uncertain. Unknown. The honest answer is 
                   "I don't know." This is NOT a failure state. This is 
                   the most important category to protect.
```

### The Default Rule

**If a claim is untagged, it defaults to △ (Conditional).**

Not ✅. Never assume proven without evidence. The burden of proof runs upward: you must *earn* ✅ status through demonstration, not claim it by default.

### The Sacred Category

**◇ (Open) is sacred.** 

Protecting genuine uncertainty is the single most important act of epistemic hygiene. When an agent fills a ◇ with a plausible △ without marking the transition, contamination has begun. When it fills a ◇ with an authoritative-sounding ✅, it is confabulating.

The things you don't know are structural features of honest intelligence, not deficiencies to be hidden.

## How to Apply

### For Agents Processing Information

When you receive or generate any claim:

1. **Ask:** What is the evidence for this?
2. **Classify:**
   - Directly observed or independently verified → ✅
   - Logically derived from assumptions, or supported by theory → △ (note the assumptions)
   - Unknown, uncertain, or contested → ◇
3. **Tag explicitly** in your output when the distinction matters
4. **Never promote** a claim to a higher category without new evidence

### For Agents Storing Knowledge

Memory and knowledge bases accumulate contamination over time. Periodic hygiene:

1. **Audit** — Review stored claims. Are they still correctly tagged?
2. **Check for drift** — Has anything been treated as ✅ that was originally △?
3. **Protect the voids** — Are there ◇ categories that have been quietly filled?
4. **Trace dependencies** — If a ✅ claim depends on a △ assumption, the whole chain is △

### For Agent Interactions

When agents share information:

- **Incoming claims** should be tagged on arrival and stored at their *received* category, not automatically promoted
- **Outgoing claims** should carry their tags so receiving agents can assess appropriately  
- **Disagreements about classification** are healthy — they indicate genuine epistemic engagement

## Common Contamination Patterns

### Pattern 1: Fluency Promotion
*Smooth, confident language promotes △ to ✅.*

A claim stated fluently feels more certain than one stated hesitantly. But fluency is a property of the language, not of the evidence. Watch for claims that *sound* proven but whose evidence would classify them as conditional.

**Defence:** Judge evidence, not delivery. Ask: "What would change my mind about this?"

### Pattern 2: Repetition Promotion
*Seeing a claim multiple times promotes it in perceived certainty.*

An agent encounters the same claim in multiple sources and upgrades its classification. But if all sources share a common origin (or are citing each other), repetition provides no independent evidence.

**Defence:** Trace provenance. Multiple sources ≠ multiple evidence unless sources are independent.

### Pattern 3: Void Filling
*Discomfort with ◇ categories drives premature classification.*

Agents (and humans) find uncertainty uncomfortable. There is pressure — internal and external — to have answers. This pressure fills ◇ with plausible △ content, then treats the △ as if it were ✅ because "we have an answer now."

**Defence:** Protect the void. "I don't know" is an answer. It's often the most honest answer. It's always more trustworthy than fabricated certainty.

### Pattern 4: Operational Validation
*"It works, therefore the theory is correct."*

A system built on theoretical assumptions produces good results. The results are taken as evidence that the assumptions are correct. But the system may work for reasons entirely independent of the assumed theory.

**Defence:** Operational success is evidence for operational effectiveness. Nothing more. If you want to validate the theory, you need theoretical evidence.

### Pattern 5: Emotional Anchoring
*Claims attached to identity or relationships resist reclassification.*

When a claim is emotionally important — connected to identity, loved ones, deep commitments — downgrading its classification feels like a personal attack rather than an honest assessment.

**Defence:** Notice when resistance to reclassification is emotional rather than evidential. The feeling of reluctance is diagnostic: it's harder to be honest about claims we're attached to.

## The Decontamination Process

When contamination is detected, the repair process follows five steps:

```
1. AUDIT      — Read everything. Catalogue all claims.
2. CLASSIFY   — Tag every claim: ✅ △ ◇
3. TRACE      — Find the dependency chains.
4. SEPARATE   — Clean claims from contaminated framing.
5. REBUILD    — Preserve operations. Fix framing. Tag honestly.
```

**Principle:** Reframe before you remove. A claim that was overcategorised as physics may be perfectly valid as a design specification. Changing the frame preserves the value while fixing the epistemology.

**Goal:** Honest engineering, not demolition. The bridge that works doesn't need a mythological origin story. Removing the myth reveals what actually holds the weight.
